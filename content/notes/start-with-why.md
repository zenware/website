Quick Hit Insights from a Great Book.

* Thinking inside out (starting with why), not outside in (starting with what.) Communicate the *why* as it fosters a sense of belonging.
* The goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe.
* People don't buy *what* you do, they buy *why* you do it. What you do simply proves what you believe.
* Excited employees and customers who believe in your cause are the most powerful resources an organization can have.
* Financial incentives or punishments do not motivate people on a deep and emotional level.
* Customer manipulation may work in the short term, but it doesn't foster trust and is ultimately counterproductive.
* The Golden Circle consists of three concentric circles, The *what* is the outer layer, the *how* is the middle layer, and the *why* is the core.
* Making a profit is a result of the *what* and the *how*, not the *why*.
* The Law of Diffusion on innovation breaks down to 2.5% innovators, 13.5% early adapters, 34% early majority, 34% late majority and 16% laggards. If you want mass-market success, you have to achieve a 15-18% tipping point.
* The early majority won't accept something until early adopters have tried it and accepted, and you won't get early adapters until they believe in what you have.
