## Who Am I?

I'm **Jay**, a lifelong autodidact and I absolutely cannot keep my paws off the *shiny new thing*. I love trying out new hobbies and diving deep into new technologies. My professional background spans Linux Admin, Full-Stack Software Development, and ICS Cybersecurity.

- 2010-2017 Helped local businesses solve problems with computers
- 2017-2019 Supported F500 ISP Operations across the US
- 2019-2024 Built Cybersecurity software running on a power plant near you.

## Why This Blog?

My hope is that I can finally start to [Learn in Public,](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) and as a result the content here will primarily be for me, but if you're here I hope you can get some use out of it too!

I also have the fantasy that I will one day begin the slog of converting decades of private notes into something suitable for public consumption. There should be plenty of content on thing I've learned over the years related to Linux, Software, WebDev, building and maintaining Self-Hosted Infra, etc.
