# Zola Templates

https://www.getzola.org/documentation/templates/

I'm starting with an off-the shelf theme so I can get to content production
more quickly. The following [zola themes](https://www.getzola.org/themes/)
appeal to me right off the bat.

- [Clean Blog](https://www.getzola.org/themes/clean-blog/)
- [dose](https://github.com/oltdaniel/dose)
- [simplify](https://www.getzola.org/themes/simplify/)

dose and simplify appear to support light & dark modes, and simplify makes use
of a css framework called [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org/) which very much
aligns with a more minimalist / "just write html" philosophy.

I will start with simplify and develop a custom theme as I go along
Here are some notes on how to use it:
